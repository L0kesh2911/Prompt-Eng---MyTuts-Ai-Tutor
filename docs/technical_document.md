## Executive Summary

MYTUTS addresses a critical problem in education: students waste 40% of their study time searching through textbooks instead of actively learning. This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that transforms static educational materials into interactive AI tutors.

The system successfully processes large PDF documents, creates searchable knowledge bases, and generates personalized explanations based on user queries. Testing with a 40MB physics textbook showed excellent performance, processing 2,196 text chunks and generating contextually relevant responses.

## Implementation Details

### Technical Approach

**RAG Implementation Strategy:**
I chose a practical approach that balances functionality with development speed. Instead of complex vector embeddings that require significant setup overhead, the system uses sophisticated keyword matching with multiple scoring factors.

**Search Algorithm:**
The search mechanism calculates similarity scores based on:
- Word overlap between query and content chunks
- Exact phrase matching for precise concept identification
- Sequential word matching for better context recognition
- Confidence scoring to rank the most relevant results

**Prompt Engineering Framework:**
Different prompt templates handle various complexity levels:
- Beginner mode uses analogies and simple language
- Advanced mode provides technical details and mathematical relationships
- Context management ensures responses stay grounded in uploaded materials
- Error handling gracefully manages edge cases and insufficient context

### Design Decisions

**Why Google AI Instead of Other Options:**
After encountering dependency issues with ChromaDB and exhausted credits with Anthropic's Claude, I evaluated several alternatives. Google AI Studio offered the best combination of:
- Completely free tier with generous limits
- Reliable API performance and uptime
- High-quality text generation capabilities
- Simple integration without complex dependencies

**Document Processing Choices:**
The chunking strategy uses sentence-aware splitting rather than simple character limits. This preserves context better and reduces the chance of breaking concepts across chunk boundaries. The 1000-character chunk size with 100-character overlap provides good retrieval granularity while maintaining readability.

**Interface Design Philosophy:**
The Streamlit interface prioritizes clarity and ease of use. Students shouldn't need technical knowledge to benefit from the system. The sidebar-main layout follows conventional web application patterns, and real-time feedback keeps users informed during processing.

## Challenges and Solutions

### Major Challenges Encountered

**1. Dependency Hell with ML Libraries**
*Problem:* Initial implementation used ChromaDB and sentence-transformers, leading to complex dependency conflicts on Windows systems. ONNX runtime issues and version incompatibilities created significant setup barriers.

*Solution:* Pivoted to a simpler architecture using keyword-based search and direct API integration. This eliminated complex ML dependencies while maintaining functionality. The trade-off was acceptable since keyword matching performs well for educational content.

**2. API Service Selection and Costs**
*Problem:* Originally planned to use Anthropic's Claude API, but encountered credit limitations during testing phase. OpenAI also required payment for meaningful usage during development.

*Solution:* Discovered Google AI Studio's generous free tier offering 1,500 requests daily. The Gemini 1.5 Flash model provides excellent performance for educational question-answering tasks without cost barriers.

**3. PDF Processing Complexity**
*Problem:* Academic textbooks often contain complex formatting, mathematical symbols, and varied layouts that challenge simple text extraction approaches.

*Solution:* Implemented robust error handling for page-by-page processing. Pages that fail extraction are skipped rather than crashing the entire process. Added page markers for better citation tracking.

**4. Context Window Management**
*Problem:* Large textbooks generate thousands of text chunks, but API calls have token limits. Balancing comprehensive context with practical constraints required careful optimization.

*Solution:* Developed a scoring system that prioritizes the most relevant chunks for each query. Limited context to top 3 matches while ensuring sufficient information for quality responses.

### Technical Lessons Learned

**Practical Development Insights:**
- Simple solutions often outperform complex ones for MVP development

## Ethical Considerations

### Data Privacy and Security

**Student Data Protection:**
The system processes uploaded educational materials but doesn't permanently store student documents or personal information. All processing happens during active sessions, and documents are cleared when sessions end. This approach protects student privacy while providing functionality.

**API Data Handling:**
Queries sent to Google AI for processing may be retained by the service provider according to their terms. Students should be informed that their questions and document excerpts are processed by third-party AI services. For sensitive materials, local processing alternatives should be considered.

### Content Accuracy and Academic Integrity

**Source Attribution:**
The system always provides citations and source references for generated responses. This encourages proper academic practices and allows students to verify information against original sources. However, AI-generated explanations should supplement, not replace, careful reading of original materials.

**Bias and Representation:**
Educational content may contain historical biases or outdated perspectives, especially in older textbooks. The AI system may inadvertently amplify these biases in generated responses. Students should be encouraged to think critically about AI-generated explanations and consult multiple sources.

### Responsible Use Guidelines

**Academic Support vs. Cheating:**
MYTUTS is designed to enhance understanding, not circumvent learning. The system provides explanations and study aids but requires students to engage actively with the material. Institutions should establish clear guidelines about appropriate use for assignments and examinations.

**Limitation Awareness:**
Students should understand that AI explanations, while helpful, aren't infallible. Complex topics may require human expert guidance, and AI responses should be verified against authoritative sources when accuracy is critical.
